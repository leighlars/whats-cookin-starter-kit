## Abstract 
In this project, we will design an interactive web page for multiple users to store and search recipes! A user will be able to view recipe instructions, ingredients, and the name and cost of needed ingredients based on their pantry contents; save recipes to a 'favorites list' or 'weekly-planned' list; use the search bar to search either name of recipe or recipes that include a searched ingredient within all recipes, their planned recipes, their favorite recipes, or by both favorite and planned recipes; and search/filter recipes by tag.

This project will demonstrate our understanding and implementation of ES6 classes, TDD and testing suites, HTML/CSS UX/UI design, ability to write modular, reusable code that follows SRP, using array prototypes for data manipulation, and last but certainly not least, ability to follow spec/comp to complete a functional app.

## Technologies / Systems
- Javascript
- Mocha/Chai
- VSCode 
- git / Version control

## Set Up 

1. *Fork* this repository - on the top right corner of the page, click the fork button, and clone down repo into your terminal. 
2. Since you don't want your project to be named "whats-cookin-starter-kit", add an optional argument after the repo url when cloning. The command should look like this: `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`.
3. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies by running npm install to install project dependencies.
4. Run open src/index.html in the terminal to view and interact with the app.

## Reflections / Project Progression
This was an absolute whirlwind of a project. We were given a very abstract spec, and we were able to create our own goals, methods, and interpretations of what this project needed. 
If we had more time, we would want to have a more responsive site, functionality for filtering through favorite and planned recipes via tags, to alphabetize our tags on display, a mobile layout/more responsive CSS, be able to search multiple word queries, and a grocery list for all the ingredients needed for the planned recipes. We would have slowed down at the beginning to utilize a better plan with increased utilization of Git project board and issues. Alas, this was our first project with this level of autonomy, and we are grateful for that experience moving forward.
